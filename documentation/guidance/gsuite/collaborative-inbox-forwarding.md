# G Suite Collaborative Inbox Forwarding
This step by step guide will help you to connect your own Gmail account to a Helpful Engineering collaborative inbox. Before you start, please get in touch with a member of the [#devops](https://helpfulengineering.slack.com/archives/CV54M16QH) team in order to get the pertaining authorizations.

:warning: Please get in touch with one of the [#devops](https://helpfulengineering.slack.com/archives/CV54M16QH) members before starting the process, so they can hand over the required verification code as soon as you need it.

### 1. Enable application access in your account
If you don't have [two-factor authentication enabled](https://www.google.com/landing/2step/) or don't even know what it is, simply [enable access for less secure applications](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps) in your account. If you have two-factor authentication enabled, please [generate an application-specific password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) instead.

### 2. Open your [account import settings](https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/accounts) to add another address
