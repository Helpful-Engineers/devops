## Policies

* All major cloud providers (GCP, Azure, AWS) are treated with equal preference. Some centralized services may be deployed on one cloud over another based on available resources such as staff expertise, cloud vendor support/implementation, or available credits.

* **Project teams are free to choose whichever platform they are most comfortable on and will be accomodated to the best degree possible by available staff.**

* We encourage teams to assess SaaS offerings before pursuing custom implementation as we try to balance time to implement, operational overhead, and cost. Our goal is for project teams to deliver value as quickly as possible.
* For the same reasons, DevOps team members are encouraged to meet teams where they are (within reason) in order to ensure they are not blockers to product development

* The organization is structured around core teams who deliver central functionality that can be used by other teams and liaison teams who assist with project delivery and communicate with core teams to leverage existing work and architectural discussion

* Public discussion is encouraged as much as possible.  Private conversation should be used for things of a sensitive nature, but there should rarely be discussions and decisions that are generated behind closed doors.

* Team members will endeavor to use inclusive language to make sure that all team members feel welcome in each and every conversation
