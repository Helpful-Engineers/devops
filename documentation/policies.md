## Policies

* All major cloud providers (GCP, Azure, AWS) are treated with equal preference.  Some centralized services may be deployed on once cloud over another based on staff experise.

* **Project teams are free to choose whichever platform they are most comfortable on and will be accomodated to the best degree possible by available staff.**

* Not because we are aginst runnng infrastructure, but there is a definite preference for SaaS when possible in order for product teams to go fast
* For the same reasons, DevOps team members are encouraged to meet teams where they are (within reason) in order to ensure they are not blockers to product development

* The organization is structured around core teams who deliver central functionality that can be used by other teams and liaison teams who assist with project delivery and communicate with core teams to leverage existing work and architectural discussion

* Public discussion is encouraged as much as possible.  Private conversation should be used for things of a sensitive nature, but there should rarely be discussions and decisions that are generated behind closed doors.

* Team members will endeavor to use inclusive language to make sure that all team members feel welcome in each and every conversation
