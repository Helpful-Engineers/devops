# Helpful Engineering Shared Credentials

Whenever possible, no account should be shared with other users.  However, in some instances (e.g. social media accounts, some email accounts, *et cetera*) it will be required to share a single set of credentials with multiple users by using a tool called **[1Password](https://1password.com)**.

The DevOps and Infosec teams maintain a master account where all credentials are stored and shared with the approved users. Passwords are being rotated regularly for security reasons, and the new ones will automatically synchronize in the other users' 1Password vaults. 

:warning: Credentials should **never** be shared outside the password manager: please **do not** send passwords in plaintext by any other means.

## Getting started

Just send your email address to the _Infosec_ team ([#skill-infosec](https://app.slack.com/client/TUTSYURT3/CV4TYGC1Z)) and you'll be added to 1Password with access to the shared secrets you're allowed to use. If you already have a 1Password account, use its email address when requesting access.

If you aren't part of the [@admin-group](https://helpfulengineering.slack.com/admin/user_groups) in Slack, approval for access will be required.

Now, you can proceed to set up your browser and devices following this guide: https://support.1password.com/explore/team-member/

:warning: **Do not forget your master password nor your [secret key](https://support.1password.com/secret-key-security/)!** They are unique to you and cannot be reset by anybody; losing them will keep you from accessing all your passwords.

## Changing passwords

When changing a password, you should generate the new one with the password manager, so it's automatically shared with all the authorized users. If you're not familiar with 1Password, please check this guide: https://support.1password.com/change-website-password/
